:: CoDeAr :: Shell ::
=====================

Command Line re-usable scaffold for coding small units of work that follow the Collect-Deliver-Archive "rhythm".

# 1. Overview

## 1.1. Goal and Objectives

## 1.2. Scope

The code of this simple kit in Shell is compatible with bash and ksh. It makes no assumption if it is or it is not compatible under other shells, such as tcsl, dash or zsh.

## 1.3. Terms and Concepts

# 2. Milestones

## 2.1. Logging

## 2.2. Command-Line Options

There are 3 ways of handling command-line options in Shell:

- Parsing Command-Line Arguments in a loop;
- Using **getopt**;
- Using **getopts**.

Although **getopt** in recent Unix distributions, such as Linux, works well ( with both short and long options ) it does not work so well on BSD variants. And since **getopts**, although more recent, can't cope with long options it seems that the only choice is to manually parse the command line options in a loop.
